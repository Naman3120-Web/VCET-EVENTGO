# 🗓️ VCET EVENTGO

**A centralized discovery and notification platform for Vidyalankar College of Engineering and Technology.**

---

## 📌 Project Overview

VCET hosts a vibrant ecosystem of departments, clubs, and committees organizing seminars, workshops, and academic competitions. However, information is often lost in the noise of scattered platforms.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The Problem:** Event details are currently fragmented across individual department sites, WhatsApp groups, physical posters, and various social media pages, leading to missed opportunities for students.

**The Solution:** A unified, trusted platform where all VCET events and academic updates are presented in a structured, searchable, and department-wise manner.

## 🧠 Why This Platform Matters

Despite existing department websites, students often struggle because:

1. **Fragmentation:** Checking 5+ websites daily is inefficient.
2. **Discoverability:** Important updates are often buried under static content.
3. **Prioritization:** It is hard to distinguish between a minor update and a major seminar.

**VCET EVENTGO** solves this by aggregating, highlighting, and saving time, which directly leads to **increased student participation.**
